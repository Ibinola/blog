I've decided to pick Java as a new programming language to learn, complementing my role as an intern where I work with Angular and TypeScript. Coming from a JavaScript and React background, the transition to Angular was initially challenging. However, as I immersed myself in its syntax and developed a better mental model, I began to appreciate its power, especially in conjunction with TypeScript.

Interestingly, as I delved deeper into Angular, I noticed certain similarities between Angular and Java. Both embrace the object-oriented paradigm, employing concepts like classes, objects, and inheritance to structure code effectively. Moreover, they share common elements such as decorators, which provide metadata and allow for behavior modification in classes.

However, it's essential to note that while Angular is a JavaScript framework primarily used for web development, Java is a separate programming language with diverse applications beyond the web. Angular leverages TypeScript, a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing and OOP features, while Java boasts its inherent support for OOP concepts and static typing.

The exploration of these similarities between Angular and Java has sparked my interest in diving into the world of Java. I'm excited to leverage my existing knowledge of Angular and TypeScript to accelerate my learning journey in Java, broadening my skill set and enhancing my understanding of different programming paradigms. My goal is to get a solid grasp of Java while building projects.

I'm currently going through [Angie Jone's Java Course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/java/), an amazing instructor. I can't wait to get started!
